# NFT Marketplace Website Documentation



## Overview

Welcome to the NFT Marketplace website project. This repository contains the code for a platform built with React (frontend) and Node.js (backend). Our goal is to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase that can scale over time.

## Code Structure

### Modular Design

Individual Sections: Each section of the site is contained within a separate .js file.
Enhanced Readability: Modular files make the project easier to read and maintain.
Effective Management: Helps developers in managing and updating features efficiently.

### Component-Based Architecture
Reusable Components: React's architecture allows us to build reusable components.
Integration: Components can be integrated seamlessly across the application.
DRY Principle: Promotes the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle to avoid code duplication.

### CSS Organization
Component-Scoped Styles: Each .js file has a corresponding .css file to keep styles scoped and organized.
Conflict-Free: This approach minimizes styling conflicts.
Theming: Facilitates easier theming and global styling adjustments.

## How to Use This Repository
Clone this repository to get started with the NFT Marketplace website code. The project structure and coding practices are designed to be straightforward and developer-friendly.

Ensure you have Node.js and npm/yarn installed to manage the backend and frontend dependencies, respectively.

### Results
